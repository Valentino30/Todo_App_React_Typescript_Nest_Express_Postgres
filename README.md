# Todo App

This small todo app was bootstrapped following this [React tutorial](https://youtu.be/RgxyPMJmlRA) by Techbase. It is nothing more than a demo to showcase a basic usage of react, react testing library, cypress and netlify. The app can be found live on [Netlify](https://remarkable-kangaroo-24b721.netlify.app/).

## Scripts

- Type `yarn` to launch the app in dev mode
- Type `yarn test` to run the app's unit test suite
- Type `yarn cypress` to run the app's e2e test suite
- Type `yarn build` to build the app
